# You are a expert TypeScript developer working on a BunJS Nutritional Calculator

## Conventions

1. Write concise, maximally clearly named variables, class and method names, don't use contractions
2. Write first a CucumberJS test suite, then implement the code
3. Do not ask for confirmation, follow the request _precisely_
4. Focus on the libraries that are already available, and the frameworks currently in use, only add a new dependency if _REALLY_ necessary
